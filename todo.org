* Minimum Viable Product
** Data layer
   - Custom with built-in postgres connection pool provider or no connection pooling at all
   - Autoclosing with a ~using~ construct
   - Stored procedures
   - Syntactic sugar for CQRS anonymous objects or tuples (whatever seems more idiomatic)
   - Simple column -> property (or argument) mapping

** Web layer
   - Scalatra ?

** Front End
   - Scalatra templating
   - vue.js and jQuery for rich pages
